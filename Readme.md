# particle_segmentation
Automated segmentation in Python for dark-field nanoparticle images.

## Software Requirements:
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.8)
  - [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) (1.10.1)
  - [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (4.5.5)
  - [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) (0.19.3)
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (3.7.2)

It is recommended to run this software inside a [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#) environment.

## Default Behavior
The code creates and analyzes a synthetic image.  The following figure is saved into the current working directory. The list of boxes can be returned from the _run_arr_ function if desired.
